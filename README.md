# Among Us Game settings unlocker
## What does it do?
As you know, in Among Us you can't change map or impostor amount unless you recreate a lobby. We don't know why Innersloth did like that, but we don't like it!\
So basically, this patch allows unlocks game option marked as "hide for online". For now there are only 3 such options: Map and impostor amount

# How to install
For now this patch has 3 versions: [static](https://github.com/Galster2010/GameSettingsUnlocker/tree/static), [runtime](https://github.com/Galster2010/GameSettingsUnlocker/tree/runtime) and [BepInEx](https://github.com/Galster2010/GameSettingsUnlocker/tree/BepInEx)

- [Static](https://github.com/Galster2010/GameSettingsUnlocker/tree/static) (recommended)
    Patches game's executable, which means you can even need to launch it only once
- [Runtime](https://github.com/Galster2010/GameSettingsUnlocker/tree/runtime)
    For people who scared about file editing.\
    It patches memory at runtime which means you have to launch every time you want to use it.
- [BepInEx](https://github.com/Galster2010/GameSettingsUnlocker/tree/BepInEx)
    For people who scared about file editing, but also have [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/) installed
    Just a [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/) plugin which doesn't conflict with any others (i hope)
